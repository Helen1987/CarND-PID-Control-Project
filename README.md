# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---

## Implementation

Parameters for PID were tuned manually. Here you can find considerations:
* Generally, we should not change our speed too quickly. Therefore, our final `Kp` coefficient is small enough `0.103`
* Cumulative error should influence our error only in case we keep moving far from trajectory significant amount of time. Therefore, `Ki` coefficient is small `0.000005`
* When our trajectory changes drastically (it means the difference between two consequent _cte_ is large), we should adjust our speed accordingly. Therefore, `Kd` coefficient is large `0.98`

  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `./install-mac.sh` or `./install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.
